### Nightfall_Code_Scanner - a code review tool that protects you from committing sensitive information

The `nightfall_code_scanner` is a code review tool that protects you from committing sensitive information to your
version control. It is intended to be used as a part of your CI to simplify the development process, improve your
security, and ensure you never accidentally leak secrets or other sensitive information via an accidental commit.

## NightfallDLP Config File

The `.nightfalldlp/config.json` file contains configuration to define which detectors to use when scanning
content from pull requests. If you do not explicitly define this config file in your code repository, the default
config will be equivalent to the snippet below:

```json
{
  "detectionRules": [
    {
      "logicalOp": "ANY",
      "name": "Nightfall Default Detection Rule",
      "detectors": [
        {
          "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
          "nightfallDetector": "API_KEY",
          "minConfidence": "POSSIBLE",
          "minNumFindings": 1
        },
        {
          "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
          "nightfallDetector": "CRYPTOGRAPHIC_KEY",
          "minConfidence": "POSSIBLE",
          "minNumFindings": 1
        },
        {
          "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
          "nightfallDetector": "PASSWORD_IN_CODE",
          "minConfidence": "POSSIBLE",
          "minNumFindings": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "annotationLevel": "failure"
}
```

If you plan on using non-default settings, the config file supports the following options:

### Detection Rule UUIDs

A Detection Rule UUID is a unique identifier for a [Detection Rule](https://docs.nightfall.ai/docs/entities-and-terms-to-know#detection-rules)
that has been built in the [Nightfall Dashboard](https://app.nightfall.ai/detection-engine/detection-rules). Users can copy a set of UUIDs from
the dashboard, then paste them into the config file, like below:

```json
{ "detectionRuleUUIDs": ["A0BA0D76-78B4-4E10-B653-32996060316B", "c035c4f3-eeb2-4764-a715-c8461f388661"] }
```

### Detection Rules

Detection Rules are a list of detectors specified inline. In addition to the list of inline detector definitions, a
detection rule contains an optional display name, as well as an operator `logicalOp` that is applied to the list
of detectors.

```json
{
  "detectionRules": [
    {
      "name": "my detection rule",
      "logicalOp": "ANY",
      "detectors": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The `logicalOp` field supports two values: `ANY` (logical OR), and `ALL` (logical AND).
Consider scanning the payload `"my ssn is 678-99-8212"` against a detection rule containing the `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER` and
`US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER` detectors with the logical op `ANY`. In this case, Nightfall would return a finding for the
string `678-99-8212` from the SSN detector. However, scanning this same payload with a logical op of `ALL` will not
return any findings, since the string does not contain any credit card numbers.

### Detector

A detector represents the atomic unit of scanning for sensitive data. The simplest examples of detectors leverage
Nightfall's pre-built detectors for data types such as `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER` or `API_KEY`. The list of available
detectors is available [here](https://docs.nightfall.ai/docs/detector-glossary). As an example:

```json
  {
    "detector": {
      "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
      "nightfallDetector": "API_KEY",
      "displayName": "apiKeyDetector",
      "minNumFindings": 1,
      "minConfidence": "LIKELY"
    }
  }
```

Two common configurations across all types of detectors are:
- `minNumFindings`: an integer number of findings that must match the input string in order for Nightfall to return a finding
- `minConfidence`: the minimum confidence threshold that Nightfall must meet in order to return a finding. This field is a string enum; possible values are defined [in the API docs](https://docs.nightfall.ai/docs/entities-and-terms-to-know#confidence-levels).

## Additional Configuration

In addition to detection rule configuration, you can also use your config file to further customize the scan process.

### Token Exclusion

To ignore specific tokens, you can add the `tokenExclusionList` field to your config. The `tokenExclusionList` is a
list of strings, and it mutes findings that match any of the provided regular expression patterns.

Here's an example use case:

```
tokenExclusionList: ["NF-gGpblN9cXW2ENcDBapUNaw3bPZMgcABs", "^127\\."]
```

In the example above, findings with the API token `NF-gGpblN9cXW2ENcDBapUNaw3bPZMgcABs`, as well as
IP addresses starting with `127.`, would not be reported. For more information on how we match tokens, take a
look at [the docs](https://docs.nightfall.ai/docs/entities-and-terms-to-know#custom-detectors).

### File Inclusion/Exclusion

The field `fileExclusionList` specifies glob patterns for files that should not be scanned during CI.
Conversely, the field `fileInclusionList` specifies glob patterns for the files that should be scanned during CI.

Here's an example use case:

```
    fileExclusionList: ["*/tests/*"],
    fileInclusionList: ["*.go", "*.json"]
```

In the example, we are ignoring all file paths with a `tests` subdirectory, and only scanning on `go` and `json` files.

### Redaction

Redaction can be configured by using the key `defaultRedactionConfig`. Nightfall supports the following keys on this
object:
* `maskConfig`: replacing findings with a character; for example the SSN `678-99-8212` might be masked as `***-**-****`.
* `substitutionConfig`: replacing findings with a custom phrase, such as `oh no! ðŸ™ˆ`
* `infoTypeSubstitutionConfig`: replacing findings with the name of the matched info type, such as `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER`.
* `cryptoConfig`: using an RSA public key to encrypt findings

If your config file specifies a non-null value for `defaultRedactionConfig`, then exactly one of the above keys must be
filled out; if more than one is filled out, the Nightfall API will return a 400 error code.

For more information on how to configure redaction-related fields, refer to the [Nightfall docs](https://docs.nightfall.ai/reference/scanpayloadv3).

### Annotation Level customization

Annotations can be configured to be `notice`, `warning`, or `failure`, by setting the `annotationLevel` key in the
configuration object. The check will only fail if `failure` annotations are written.
