### Nightfall_Code_Scanner - a code review tool that protects you from committing sensitive information

nightfall_code_scanner scans your code for secrets or sensitive information. Itâ€™s intended to be used as a part of your CI to simplify the development process, improve your
security, and ensure you never accidentally leak secrets or other sensitive information via an accidental commit.

## Supported Services

### GithubActions

[nightfall_dlp_action](https://github.com/nightfallai/nightfall_dlp_action)

## Nightfalldlp Config File

The `.nightfalldlp/config.json` file is used as a centralized config file to control what conditions/detectors to scan
with and what content you want to scan for pull requests. It includes the following adjustable fields to fit your needs.

TODO (emf): bump to DetectionRuleUUIDs
### ConditionSetUUID

A condition set uuid is a unique identifier of a condition set, which can be created via [app.nightfall.ai](app.nightfall.ai).
Once defined, you can simply input the uuid in the your config file, e.g.

```json
{ "conditionSetUUID": "A0BA0D76-78B4-4E10-B653-32996060316B" }
```

Note: by default, if both conditionSetUUID and conditions are specified, only the conditionSetUUID will be used.

### Conditions

TODO (emf): bump to DetectionRules
Conditions are a list of conditions specified inline. Each condition contains a nested detector object as well as two additional parameters: minNumFindings and minConfidence.

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "minNumFindings": 1,
      "minConfidence": "POSSIBLE",
      "detector": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

minNumFindings specifies the minimal number of findings required to return for one request, e.g. if you set minNumFindings to be 2, and only 1 finding within the request payload related to that detector, that finding then will be filtered out from the response.

minConfidence specifies the minimal threshold to trigger a potential finding to be captured. We have five levels of confidence from least sensitive to most sensitive:

- VERY_LIKELY
- LIKELY
- POSSIBLE
- UNLIKELY
- VERY_UNLIKELY

### Detector

A detector is either a prebuilt Nightfall detector or custom regex or wordlist detector that you can create. This is specified by the detectorType field.

- nightfall prebuilt detector

  ```json
  {
    "detector": {
      "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
      "nightfallDetector": "API_KEY",
      "displayName": "apiKeyDetector"
    }
  }
  ```

  Within detector struct

  - First specify detectorType as NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR
  - Pick the nightfall detector you want from the list
    - API_KEY
    - CRYPTOGRAPHIC_KEY
    - RANDOMLY_GENERATED_TOKEN
    - CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER
    - US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER
    - AMERICAN_BANKERS_CUSIP_ID
    - US_BANK_ROUTING_MICR
    - ICD9_CODE
    - ICD10_CODE
    - US_DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER
    - US_PASSPORT
    - PHONE_NUMBER
    - IP_ADDRESS
    - EMAIL_ADDRESS
  - Put a display name for your detector, as this will be attached on your findings

- customized regex

  We also support customized regex as a detector, which are defined as followed:

  ```json
  {
    "detector": {
      "detectorType": "REGEX",
      "regex": {
        "pattern": "coupon:\\d{4,}",
        "isCaseSensitive": false
      },
      "displayName": "simpleRegexCouponDetector"
    }
  }
  ```

- word list

  Word list detectors look for words you specify in its list. Example below:

  ```json
  {
    "detector": {
      "detectorType": "WORD_LIST",
      "wordList": {
        "values": ["key", "credential"],
        "isCaseSensitive": false
      },
      "displayName": "simpleWordListKeyDetector"
    }
  }
  ```

- [Extra Parameters Within Detector]

  Aside from specifying which detector to use for a condition, you can also specify some additional rules to attach. They are contextRules and exclusionRules.

  - contextRules
    A context rule evaluates the surrounding context(pre/post chars) of a finding and adjusts the finding's confidence if the input context rule pattern exists.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "detector": {
        // ...... other detector fields
        "contextRules": [
          {
            "regex": {
              "pattern": "my cc",
              "isCaseSensitive": true
            },
            "proximity": {
              "windowBefore": 30,
              "windowAfter": 30
            },
            "confidenceAdjustment": {
              "fixedConfidence": "VERY_LIKELY"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    - regex field specifies a regex to trigger
    - proximity is defined as the number pre|post chars surrounding the finding to conduct the search
    - confidenceAdjustment is the confidence level to adjust the finding to upon existence of the input context

    As an example, say we have the following line of text in a file `my cc number: 4242-4242-4242-4242`, and `4242-4242-4242-4242` is detected as a credit card number with confidence of POSSIBLE. If we had the context rule above, the confidence level of this finding will be bumped up to `VERY_LIKELY` because the characters preceding the finding, `my cc`, match the regex.

  - exclusionRules
    Exclusion rules on individual conditions are used to mute findings related to that condition's detector.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "detector": {
        // ...... other detector fields
        "exclusionRules": [
          {
            "matchType": "PARTIAL",
            "exclusionType": "REGEX",
            // specify one of these values based on the type specified above
            "regex": {
              "pattern": "4242-4242-\\d{4}-\\d{4}",
              "isCaseSensitive": true
            },
            "wordList": {
              "values": ["4242"],
              "isCaseSensitive": false
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    - exclusionType specifies either a REGEX or WORD_LIST
    - regex field specifies a regex to trigger, if you choose to use REGEX type
    - matchType could be either PARTIAL or FULL, To be a full match, the entire finding must match the regex pattern or word exactly, whereas findings containing more than just the regex pattern or word are considered partial matches. Example: suppose we have a finding of "4242-4242" with exclusion regex of 4242. If you use PARTIAL, this finding will be deactivated, while FULL not, since the regex only matches partial of the finding

## Additional Configuration

Aside from which conditions to scan on, you can add additional fields to your config, `./nightfall/config.json`, to ignore tokens and files as well as specify which files to exclusively scan on.

### Token Exclusion

To ignore specific tokens, you can add the `tokenExclusionList` field to your config. The `tokenExclusionList` is a list of strings, and it mutes findings that match any of the given regex patterns.

Here's an example use case:

`tokenExclusionList: ["NF-gGpblN9cXW2ENcDBapUNaw3bPZMgcABs", "^127\\."]`

In the example above, findings with the API token `NF-gGpblN9cXW2ENcDBapUNaw3bPZMgcABs` as well as local IP addresses starting with `127.` would not be reported. For more information on how we match tokens, take a look at [regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).

### File Inclusion/Exclusion

To omit files from being scanned, you can add the `fileExclusionList` field to your config. In addition, to only scan on certain files, add the `fileInclusionList` to the config.

Here's an example use case:

```

    fileExclusionList: ["*/tests/*"],
    fileInclusionList: ["*.go", "*.json"]

```

In the example, we are ignoring all file paths with a `tests` subdirectory, and only scanning on `go` and `json` files.
Note: we are using [gobwas/glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob) to match file path patterns. Unlike the token regex matching, file paths must be completely matched by the given pattern. e.g. If `tests` is a subdirectory, it will not be matched by `tests/*`, which is only a partial match.

## Configuration Examples

- Using a pre-built condition set

```json
{ "conditionSetUUID": "UUID HERE" }
```

- Inline condition set with Nightfall Detectors

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {

        "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",
        "nightfallDetector": "API_KEY",
        "displayName": "nfAPIKEY"
      }
    },

    {
      "minNumFindings": 2,
      "minConfidence": "POSSIBLE",
      "detector": {
        "detectorType": "NIGHTFALL_DETECTOR",

      }
    }
  ]
}
```
